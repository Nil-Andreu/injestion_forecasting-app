# Injestion Notebooks

We will be making injestion & cleaning of data resources.
We will be consuming different APIs as well as will be making web scraping.

To run the Dockerfile, we should run:
```
    docker build -t injestion_notebooks .
    docker images   # we can check it was created correctly

    docker run -ti injestion_notebooks:v1
```

The 0X will be different APIs we will access to.
The 1X will be tools to get data from multiple resources.
